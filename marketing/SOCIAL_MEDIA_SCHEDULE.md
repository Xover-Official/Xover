The problem with cloud optimization tools:
❌ They show you problems
❌ You still have to fix them manually
❌ Time-consuming and error-prone

Talos is different:
✅ Detects issues automatically
✅ Fixes them automatically
✅ Safe, autonomous, 24/7

How the 5-tier AI swarm works:

🟢 Sentinel (Gemini Flash): Monitors 24/7, catches obvious waste
🟣 Strategist (Gemini Pro): Cost-benefit analysis
🟡 Arbiter (Claude): Safety validation
🟢 Reasoning (GPT-5): Complex multi-step optimizations
🔴 Oracle (Devin): Critical infrastructure changes

Each tier = different risk tolerance
```

### Tweet 6 - 9:00 PM (Thank You)

```
What a day! 🙌

Day 1 results:
• 600+ signups
• Top 5 on Product Hunt
• $20K+ in estimated monthly savings for users

Thank you to everyone who supported the launch. This is just the beginning.

Tomorrow: Back to building. Got a roadmap of epic features coming 🚀

After 6 months of building, I'm launching Talos today.

The backstory:
My startup's AWS bill hit $2,400/month. Most resources were barely used. I spent hours manually optimizing, only to see costs creep back up.

There had to be a better way.

So I built Talos - an autonomous cloud guardian powered by 5 specialized AI models. Each model handles different risk levels, from quick wins to complex infrastructure changes.

Results after 1 month:
• My bill: $2,400 → $1,280 (47% drop)
• Beta tester (startup): $5,200 → $2,750 (47% drop)  
• Enterprise user: $15k → $9.2k (39% drop)

What makes it special:
✓ Fully autonomous (set it and forget it)
✓ Multi-cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP)
✓ Real-time ROI tracking
✓ Enterprise-grade security
✓ Beautiful glassmorphic dashboard

Try it free for 14 days: [link]

If you're spending >$500/mo on cloud, this will pay for itself in days.

Title: I built an autonomous cloud optimizer using a 5-tier AI swarm [Show & Tell]

After my AWS bill hit $2,400/mo for barely-used dev resources, I built Talos - an autonomous platform that uses 5 specialized AI models to continuously optimize cloud infrastructure.

Architecture:
• Sentinel (Gemini Flash): Real-time monitoring
• Strategist (Gemini Pro): Cost analysis
• Arbiter (Claude): Safety validation
• Reasoning (GPT-5): Complex decisions
• Oracle (Devin): Critical infrastructure

Each tier activates based on risk level. Low-risk changes (like rightsizing an idle t2.large) use the fast/cheap tiers. High-risk changes (like modifying prod databases) escalate to more powerful models.

Results from 4-week beta:
• My bill: -47% ($1,120/mo saved)
• Startup: -47% ($2,450/mo saved)  
• Enterprise: -39% ($5,800/mo saved)

Tech stack:
• Go backend
• PostgreSQL + Redis
• Prometheus + Grafana
• Kubernetes deployment
• Multi-cloud adapters (AWS/Azure/GCP)

Launching on Product Hunt today - would love your feedback!

Open to questions about the architecture, AI model selection, or autonomous operation safety!
