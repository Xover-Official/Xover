## 📝 Founder Story & Quotes

**Founder**: [Your Name]
**Bio**: Ex-DevOps engineer who got tired of waking up to PagerDuty alerts for "disk full" and seeing $5k AWS bills for idle dev servers. Built Talos to solve the "human bottleneck" in cloud operations.

**Quote 1 (The Problem)**:
> "Cloud complexity has outpaced human ability to manage it. We're asking engineers to be experts in Kubernetes, cost optimization, *and* twenty different AWS services. It's too much. The future is autonomous."

**Quote 2 (The Solution)**:
> "Xover isn't just a dashboard; it's an active participant. It fixes problems before you even get the alert. It's like having a senior SRE who never sleeps and works for pennies an hour."

## 🔑 Key Differentiators

1. **Autonomous Action**: Unlike cost dashboards that just *show* you problems, Xover *fixes* them (with your permission settings).
2. **5-Tier AI Swarm**: Different models for different risks. Fast/cheap models for monitoring, powerful/reasoning models for complex changes.
3. **Risk-First Design**: Built with a "do no harm" philosophy. Simulation modes and ROI calculators ensure every action is net-positive.
