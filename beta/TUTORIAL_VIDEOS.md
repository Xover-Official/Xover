### Script

**[0:00-0:15] Hook**
> "In the next 3 minutes, I'll show you how to cut your cloud costs by 40% without writing a single line of code."

**[0:15-0:45] The Problem**
> "You're running AWS, Azure, or GCP. Your bill keeps growing. You know resources are over-provisioned, but manually optimizing them is tedious and risky. What if there was a better way?"

**[0:45-1:15] The Solution**
> "Meet Talos - an autonomous cloud guardian powered by a 5-tier AI swarm. Install it in one command, and it continuously monitors and optimizes your infrastructure. Let me show you."

**[1:15-2:00] Demo: Installation**

```bash
# Show terminal
curl -fsSL https://get.talos.dev | bash

# Show progress bars
# Show "✅ Talos is running!"
```

**[2:00-2:30] Demo: Dashboard**
> "Here's your dashboard. The AI swarm is already analyzing your resources. See this risk heatmap? Red means high cost, low utilization. Talos is fixing these automatically—in the background."

**[2:30-2:45] Results**
> "After 24 hours, most users see 20-30% cost reduction. After a week? 40-50%. All autonomous. All safe."
