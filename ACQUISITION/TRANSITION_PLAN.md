# 🤝 The 30-Day Transition Plan

**Goal**: Ensure a frictionless handover of the Talos Atlas IP, codebase, and infrastructure to the Acquirer, enabling full operational capability within 30 days.

## Phase 1: Knowledge Transfer (Days 1-7)

* **The "Brain Download"**:
  * 3 x Deep-Dive Workshops (virtual) covering:
        1. **Core Architecture**: Walking through the OODA Engine and Swarm Logic.
        2. **AI Orchestration**: How to tune the prompts for Gemini, Claude, and GPT-4.
        3. **Deployment**: Kubernetes Helm charts and Infrastructure-as-Code.
* **Access Grant**:
  * Full transfer of GitHub repositories.
  * Transfer of Docker Hub / Container Registry credentials.
  * Domain name ownership transfer (`talos-atlas.io` etc.).

## Phase 2: Technical Handoff (Days 8-14)

* **Environment Replication**:
  * We will assist your DevOps team in spinning up a Talos instance in **your** VPC.
  * Validation of the CI/CD pipeline in your environment.
* **Security Key Rotation**:
  * Joint session to rotate all API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Cloud).
  * Transfer of vaulted secrets.

## Phase 3: "Co-Pilot" Period (Days 15-25)

* **Shadow Support**:
  * We remain on standby via Slack/Discord for Q&A.
  * Review of the first few code commits made by your team.
* **Roadmap Alignment**:
  * walkthrough of the `FUTURE_ROADMAP.md` to explain the rationale behind upcoming features (Projected $5M ARR potential).

## Phase 4: Final Sign-off (Days 26-30)

* **The "Kill Switch" Test**: verifying that the original creators no longer have access.
* **Documentation Audit**: Ensuring all wiki pages and docs are updated with your branding.
* **Celebration**: Official closing of the transition project.
