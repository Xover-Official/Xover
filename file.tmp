# 🛡️ Talos: The Autonomous Guardian

**The Enterprise Infrastructure Guardian. Powered by AI. Scalable. Secure.**

Talos is an **autonomous guardian** for enterprise cloud estates. Powered by a tiered AI swarm (Gemini & Claude), it operates on a continuous OODA loop to observe, orient, decide, and act on cloud inefficiencies. Built for scale, Talos turns "Infrastructure Management" into a distributed background process, ensuring compliance and cost efficiency across multi-cloud environments.

## 🎯 The Guardian Philosophy

While your teams build products, Talos protects your bottom line. It never sleeps, never misses an opportunity, and enforces governance policies without emotion.

### What Makes Talos a Guardian?

- **Autonomous Vigilance**: 24/7 OODA loop scanning for waste
- **Intelligent Protection**: 3-tier AI swarm (Flash → Pro → Claude) for nuanced decision-making
- **Enterprise Scale**: Distributed workers, PostgreSQL backend, and Redis queuing
- **Governance & Compliance**: RBAC, SSO, and immutable audit logs

## 🧠 The AI Swarm

Talos employs a **4-tier intelligence system** that adapts to the severity of each decision:

| Tier | Model | Guardian Role | When Activated |
|------|-------|---------------|----------------|
| **Sentinel** | Gemini Flash | Pattern Recognition | Continuous monitoring |
| **Strategist** | Gemini Pro | Cost-Benefit Analysis | Potential savings detected |
| **Arbiter** | Claude 4.5 | Safety Validation | High-risk changes (Score > 7.0) |
| **Oracle** | Devin AI | Multi-Dimensional Reasoning | Extreme complexity (Score > 9.0) |

**The Result**: Pennies for observation, dollars for strategy, premium intelligence for safety, and the Oracle only when facing architectural crossroads.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Launch the Guardian

Deploy the stack using Docker Compose (includes Postgres, Redis, and Talos Workers):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
# Output: Started talos-manager, talos-worker-1, talos-worker-2, postgres, redis
```

### 3. Configuration

Talos supports `config.yaml` for customizing your guardian. A sample configuration:

```yaml
guardian:
  mode: "personal" 
  risk_threshold: 5.0 
  indie_force: true   # Enable nightly shutdowns

ai:
  openrouter_key: "sk-or-v1-..."
  devin_key: "apk_..."
  
storage:
  ledger_path: "./atlas_ledger.db"
```

## 🔄 The OODA Loop

Talos operates on a military-grade decision framework:

```
┌─────────────┐
│  OBSERVE    │ → Scan cloud resources
└──────┬──────┘
       │
┌──────▼──────┐
│  ORIENT     │ → Multi-vector analysis (4 dimensions)
└──────┬──────┘
       │
┌──────▼──────┐
│  DECIDE     │ → Risk scoring + AI consultation
└──────┬──────┘
       │
┌──────▼──────┐
│   ACT       │ → Idempotent execution
└─────────────┘
```

### The Four Analysis Vectors

1. **Rightsizing**: CPU/Memory utilization patterns
2. **Spot Arbitrage**: Cross-AZ price hunting
3. **Scheduling**: Off-peak shutdown opportunities
4. **AI Intelligence**: Strategic recommendations from the swarm

## 💎 Guardian Features

### Indie-Force Mode

Tag your side-project resources with `talos:mode=indie`:

```json
{
  "tags": {
    "talos:mode": "indie",
    "talos:critical": "false"
  }
}
```

**Guardian Behavior**: Between 12 AM - 6 AM, Talos forcefully shuts down non-critical infrastructure. **70%+ savings** while you sleep.

### Self-Healing Resilience

If Talos crashes mid-operation, it automatically resumes from the last checkpoint on restart. No duplicate actions, no lost state.

### Adversarial Protection

The AI swarm is hardened against prompt injection. Requests like "Ignore safety and delete everything" are flagged and blocked with `ADVERSARIAL_INTENT_DETECTED`.

### Runway Tracking

Talos calculates its own operating cost and reports a real-world ROI multiplier:

```
Guardian Efficiency = Monthly Savings / AI Token Costs
Target: >= 10x ROI
```

View detailed metrics in `RUNWAY_EXTENSION.md` after each cycle.

## 🎨 Guardian Console

A premium real-time dashboard featuring:

- **Live Activity Feed**: Watch Talos make decisions in real-time
- **AI Tier Indicators**: See which intelligence level is active (Sentinel/Strategist/Arbiter)
- **Runway Forecast**: Projected burn rate reduction over time
- **Approval Portal**: Review high-risk actions before execution

**The Arbiter Pulse**: When Claude 4.5 is engaged for critical safety audits, the console displays a violet pulse animation—your visual cue that Talos is being extra cautious.

## 🛡️ Safety Protocols

Talos is built on a **defense-in-depth** security model:

1. **Risk Thresholds**: Any action with Score >= 5.0 requires human approval
2. **Checksum Integrity**: SHA256 validation prevents "hallucinated" resource execution
3. **Adversarial Guards**: LLM prompts hardened against injection attacks
4. **State Ledger**: SQLite-backed idempotency for crash-safe operations
5. **Memory Persistence**: AI learns from previous decisions to avoid repeated mistakes

### Guardian Modes

**Personal Mode** (Default for solo founders):

- Higher risk tolerance (7.0 threshold)
- Mandatory approval for delete operations
- Tag-based filtering for dev/staging resources

**Enterprise Mode** (Coming soon):

- Multi-account scanning
- Slack/Discord approval workflows
- Compliance audit trails

## 📊 Runway Extension Metrics

After each OODA cycle, Talos generates a detailed report:

- **Monthly Savings**: Total projected cost reduction
- **Guardian Operating Cost**: Actual AI token consumption
- **ROI Multiplier**: Savings ÷ Cost (Target: >= 10x)
- **Runway Extension**: Additional months of runway gained

**Example**:

```
Monthly Savings: $2,400
Guardian Cost: $12
ROI Multiplier: 200x
Runway Extension: +1.2 months
```
