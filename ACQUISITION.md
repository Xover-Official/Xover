## 🚀 Quick Technical Summary

TALOS addresses the $150B/year cloud waste problem through an autonomous **OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act)**. Unlike traditional tools that merely provide dashboards, TALOS **acts** on its findings using a **tiered AI Swarm** that balances cost-efficiency with high-stakes reasoning.

* **Stack**: Go (Golang), PostgreSQL, Redis, React, OpenTelemetry.
* **AI Engine**: Tiered integration with Gemini 1.5 (Pro/Flash), Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and Devin.
* **Architecture**: Distributed worker model with idempotent state management and "Guardian" safety protocols.

## ✨ Key Innovation Points

1. **Tiered Intelligence (The Swarm)**: Uses cheap LLMs for monitoring (Sentinel) and high-reasoning LLMs (Arbiter/Oracle) only for high-risk decisions, achieving 100x+ ROI on AI tokens.
2. **Context Propagation & Safety**: Every AI decision is wrapped in a "Guardian" context that prevents hallucinations and adversarial prompt injection.
3. **Double-Loop Learning**: The system records its decisions in a `ProjectMemory`, allowing it to learn from previous infrastructure changes and avoid repeating sub-optimal optimizations.
4. **Indie-Force & Enterprise Modes**: Versatile enough for solo founders (aggressive cost cutting) and enterprises (safe, audited optimizations).

## 🛡️ Enterprise Readiness (10/10)

TALOS has been refactored to meet strict enterprise standards:
* **Full Context Support**: Graceful cancellation and timeouts for all operations.
* **Structured Logging**: `zap`-based JSON logging for SIEM integration.
* **Observability**: Built-in OpenTelemetry tracing and Prometheus metrics.
* **Security**: SSO integration, RBAC, and immutable audit ledgers.

## 📈 Traction & ROI Example

- **Monthly Savings**: $2,400+ for a standard mid-size cluster.
* **Operating Cost**: <$15 in AI tokens.
* **Growth Potential**: Can be rebranded as a "Cloud Co-Pilot" or integrated into existing MSP service suites.
