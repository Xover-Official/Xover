## 🚀 Business Impact

### 1. Extend Runway

For startups, every dollar saved is a dollar that goes toward growth. TALOS typically extends runway by **10-15%** by eliminating idle resources and automated rightsizing.

### 2. Autonomous FinOps

Most companies require a dedicated FinOps team to manage cloud costs. TALOS automates **80% of routine FinOps tasks**, allowing your engineers to focus on product development.

### 3. Risk Mitigation

Unlike basic "cost explorers," TALOS uses high-reasoning AI (The Arbiter) to ensure that optimizations don't impact system stability. If an action is risky, TALOS generates a detailed explanation and waits for human approval.
